       <p>Mountain Expeditions is a small UK company owned and run by Jon Gupta. We specialise in bespoke, professional and seamlessly-run expeditions around the world.
      <br><br>
      A successful expedition is made up of the hundreds of small wonderful experiences gained from start to finish. We therefore ensure that every aspect of your trip is expertly organised and well-managed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text right">
      <p>We operate in 6 countries. We respect and value the local communities with whom we work and have nurtured and built strong relationships with them. As a result, we feel we have a deeper understanding of how to best deliver the trip of a lifetime to you.</p>

          <h1>Our Leaders</h1>
        <p>On every expedition, the number of participants is kept to a level to enable the highest quality to be maintained. We do not want to be that company where you become a number or even a blur after the expedition has finished, so we have a strict cut off point to ensure that our groups never become too big.
        <br><br>
        We strongly believe that by doing this our Mountain Expeditions Leaders are able to provide a more personalised service and we find that group dynamics work much better than when travelling in high numbers. Therefore, your success rate and enjoyment increases immeasurably.</p>
